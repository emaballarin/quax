# Example libaries

These examples demonstrate how to introduce your own types, and write your own multiple dispatch programs, in JAX.

The builtin `quax.{lora, zero}` libraries are intended to be fairly feature-complete. These example libraries are much smaller, (possibly buggier) and serve primarily as demonstrations. Although if you'd be interested in growing them into fully-fledged libraries, then get in touch.
